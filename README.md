The project is a web automated tests of the [ParaBank](https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/register.htm) website
using Selenium Webdriver and Java technologies.

## Prerequisites
- JDK 11.8.18;
- Maven 3.8.1;

- JUnit 5.9.3.

## Installation
...

## Usage
To run the automated testing, you can simply run all the tests located  at the `src/test/java` dir. This is possible
because the ParaBank application is already running on a web server. 

But if you want to run only one test case, you can open the
[`RegisterTest.java`](https://github.com/tiagocbarbosa/parabank-web-selenium/blob/main/src/test/java/org/parasoft/parabank/register/RegisterTest.java)
file as an example, and run its tests.
